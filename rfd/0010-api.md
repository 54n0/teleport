# RFD 10 - API and Client Libraries

## What

- Unify Golang Client experience.
- Automatically generate API documentation using [protoc-gen-doc](https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc).

## Why

There are several problems with the Teleport Go client libraries:

* Go library example pulls entire teleport dependency including `lib/auth` and `lib/services`.
* There is no separate client library with guarantees of compatibility with specific version of Teleport.
See examples [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#compatibility-matrix).
*  Some client logic is residing in [plugins](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/blob/master/access/access.go), while other is in `lib/auth`.
* Code in `lib/auth` uses some concepts unfamiliar to Go users:
```go
// connectClient establishes a gRPC connection to an auth server.
func connectClient() (*auth.Client, error) {
    tlsConfig, err := LoadTLSConfig("certs/api-admin.crt", "certs/api-admin.key", "certs/api-admin.cas")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to setup TLS config: %v", err)
    }

    // must prase addr list panics and is not necessary
    authServerAddr := utils.MustParseAddrList("127.0.0.1:3025")
    clientConfig := auth.ClientConfig{Addrs: authServerAddr, TLS: tlsConfig}

    // TLS client is the only client
    return auth.NewTLSClient(clientConfig)
```

It's also impossible to generate library in any other language other than Go due to unclear API surface. Teleport services, auth client, and proto generated files are all dependent on each other in some ways which make a clear distinction difficult. The goal is to make the dependency graph look like `Go stdlib <- proto <- client`, rather than `teleport libraries <- services <- proto <- client`.

## Details

The api package will be made a Go module, with no dependency on Teleport code outside of itself. This will allow for users to use different Teleport client and server versions together, as long as they are compatibible according to the compatibility matrix. This will also allow the api to have far fewer dependencies, which both lowers the api's import footprint and possible external compatibility issues.

In addition to separating out the client from internal Teleport libraries, the client needs several quality of life improvements. These changes include better client UX via easy credential loading, automatic version checking, better (generated) docs, and more language implementations.

### Make client independent

Keep Teleport's API layer unified, avoid having internal API vs external API layer. Everything needed for a client to use the api client should live within the `api` package.

```
github.com/gravitational/teleport/api:

go.mod
go.sum
api/
  client/
    client.go
    proto/
      authservice.proto
      authservice.pb.go
    ...
  types/
    types.proto
    types.pb.go
    wrappers/
      wrappers.proto
      wrappers.pb.go
    events/
      events.proto
      events.pb.go
    ...
  docs/
    tbd...
```

The access to the API surface is limited by role based access control.

Use Go's type aliases to refactor code into the `api` package while maintaining backwards compatibility.

```go
// Preserve full backwards compatibility
type services.Role = types.Role
type auth.Service = proto.Service
```

**Track dependencies**

Track dependencies for the `api` package to be limited to:
  * `gravitational/trace`
  * grpc google package and its dependencies
  * protobuf generated code

External libraries for things like json and yaml encoding should be refactored to use Go's built in libraries.

**Move client implementation to `api/client`**

Move relevant gRPC related `lib/auth.Client` code to `api/client`. Move the protobuf files to `client/proto`, along with any other client code that it depends on.

Leave the `lib/auth.Client` intact for backwards compatibility, internal use, and to retain functionality of our soon-to-be deprecated http client. Necessary endpoints should be refactored into the gRPC client, rather than moving the http client to the new `api` package.


**Separate Teleport services from protobuf types**

Currently, `lib/services` holds the protobuf files and types that the client in `lib/auth` depends on. These types and proto files must be moved to `api/types` to remove the dependency on `lib/services`, as well as to draw a clear distinction between client logic and business logic.

Many methods defined on these types are beyond the scope of an external client, such as Certificate Authority Rotation methods, and should be refactored back into services for internal use.

Use [protoc-gen-doc](https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc) to generate gRPC API markdown documentation during the protoc build process. This will require us to improve our proto files with user-focused comments.

### Client experience improvements

**Go native user experience**

Achieve the user experience in Client with a simplified client constructor.
This should also transparently handle dialing via a proxy.

```go
import (
   "github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client"
)

func main() {
   // TLS client is the only TLS client supported in teleport
   client, err := client.New(client.Config{
     Addrs: []string{"localhost:3025"},
     // ContextDialer is optional context dialer
     ContextDialer: net.DialContext,
     // direct TLS credentials config
     Credentials: client.TLSCreds(tls.Config)
   })
   ...
   defer client.Close()

   ping, err := client.Ping()
   ...
   fmt.Printf("Ping: %v\n", ping.Version)
}
```

```bash
$ go mod init
$ go run main.go
```

**Credential providers**

Support multiple credential providers with chaining

* client.TLSCreds(*tls.Config) loads creds from TLS config
* client.PathCreds("path") loads mounted creds from path, detects reloads
and updates the grpc transport

Support convenience method that supports and understands `~/.tsh/profile`,
so users can try testing using credentials they got from `tsh login`

```go
// for testing, use client spec that loads dialer, and credentials from profile
cfg, err := client.LoadTSHConfig()
// cfg.ContextDialer sets up dialer using tunnel dialer in tctl
// TLS creds are loaded from key store, similar how tctl does it in 5.0
client, err := client.New(cfg)
```

```bash
$ tsh login
# try client
$ go run main.go
```

**Auto version checks**

Client should verify that its implementation is compatible with
Teleport's server version by calling `Ping` and checking the version
similar to tsh logic.

### Move Access requests code into client

Move `access` workflows code into `client` subpackage with new name `workflows`:

https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/tree/master/access

Instead of a separate client, `workflows` becomes a subpackage of the api client:

```go
import (
   "github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client"
   "github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client/workflows"
)

func main() {
   client, err := client.New(...)
   watcher, err := workflows.NewWatcher(ctx, client, workflows.Watch{State: ...})
   ...
   defer watcher.Close()

```

### Provide simplified high level access hooks

Access hooks are too low level, add simple handler similar to http server design
with a router:

```go

func myTeamRequest(ctx context.Context, req access.Request) (access.Request, error) {
  return req, trace.AccessDenied("access denied")
}


func main() {
router := access.Router()
  // handle access requests from my team only
  router.HandleFunc(router.Match{Traits: Trait("team", "myteam")}
  srv := access.Server{
     Client: clt,
     Handler: router,
  }
```


### Improve API documentation user experience

Integrate [protoc-gen-doc](https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc) generated documentation into `mkdocs` using mkdocs plugin.

### Add Python Client

To prove that the new protobuf structure works, generate a `python` version of the
golang client. Python will be the first langauge of many new client libary implementations.


```bash
ls github.com/gravitational/teleport
api/
python/

$ pip install teleport-client
```

```python
import teleport

client = teleport.client(addr=...)
client.tokens()
```

Port router code

```python
@access.handle(clt, path=access.trait("team")):
def handle(req):
   if req.user == "bob":
      raise access.Denied("access denied")
```

Update docs to include samples in both languages, Python and Go.
