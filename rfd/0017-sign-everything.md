# Sign Everything

Require [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification) 
for protected branches `master` and `branch/x.y`.

Sign all files published to Github releases.

## Why 

Have a audit trail of all commits in the system and prevent commit author impersonation.

## How

Turn on commit signing for users and bots following steps 
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification)

**Teleport specific key repository**

Establish Teleport-specific repository of supported public keys used by core team developers and have an 
additional verification step done by Drone pipeline.

Developers should register [Yubikeys](https://www.engineerbetter.com/blog/yubikey-signed-commits/)
as used keys.

**Support for external contributors**

Once pull request from external contributor has been approved, Drone can amend the commit, sign it using our CI/CD key
and rebase to master.

**Remove the github releases files**

Remove the source releases files generated by Github and instead publish Drone-generated source files alongside the signatures and hashes.
